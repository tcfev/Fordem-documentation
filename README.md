# tagging
we normally use any of the following prefixes: 
    
ci: for continuous integration  
v: for versioning  
...

and then use either Semver for versioning, or use a six digit number starting from zero and go from there incrementally. For example:  
- ci000048  
- v.0.0.1  

# branching
- in case you are working on a bugfix name your branch like this: bugfix-BugNumber  
- if you are working on a feature call your branch: feature-Name-Of-The-Branch
