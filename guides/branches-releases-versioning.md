Software versioning

![Versioning diagram](https://github.com/scalabs/documentation/blob/main/assets/images/versioning.drawio.png)

X, Y and Z are numbers that represent different levels of releases. E.g. v0.4.2, v2.1.14

An increased major version number is reserved for very huge updates, possibly with breaking changes. This is associated with a new project initiative, with Solution Design and Execution Plan.
A minor version increase signifies a new module or re-write/redesign of an existing module. In other words, with visible changes.
A patch release includes bug-fixes and improvements to already developed modules
